Square CTF 2017: Little Doggy Tables
-------

**Catégorie**: Web **Points**: 100 **Description**:

> It's worse than we thought. We knew the androids couldn't care for the humans like we do (yes, even the cats care--stop yapping about loyalty, Agent Rover). But they don't even remember their own species.
> We've found a website that reminds them whether a given robot "agent" is a dog or a cat! And when we confronted a captured android about it, it was arrogant in the extreme:
> "Oh, so you found it. Yes, it will tell you if a given agent is a dog or a cat, by looking up the appropriate value in its SQLite database. Good luck with that.
> "Sure, the database contains some sensitive information, but our bulletproof firewall and top-notch quote escaping will ensure it never sees the light of day.
> "Not secure? Huh? You don’t believe me? I’ll show you how secure. [Here’s the source!](https://github.com/Inshallhack/Write-ups/blob/master/SquareCTF-2017/Little%20Doggy%20Tables/little_doggy_tables.rb)"
