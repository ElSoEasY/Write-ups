Square CTF 2017: The General's Cat
-------

**Catégorie**: Crypto **Points**: 50 **Description**:

> The androids’ plans for domination include securing ancient artifacts relating to the animal world to be used for nefarious means. We managed to infiltrate one of their digsites and intercepted this ancient scientific tome, but it's encrypted! We think it relates to Julius Caesar's time in Rome, for he was a great friend and benefactor to the feline community. We could use your cryptanalysis skills to determine the contents of this tome and whether it will give us any leverage against our enemies.
