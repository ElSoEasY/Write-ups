Square CTF 2017: The Robot's Grandmother
-------

**CatÃ©gorie**: Forensics **Points**: 50 **Description**:

> Every once in a while we see the Grand Robot Leader Extraordinaire communicating over email with the Grand Robot Matriarch. We suspect there might be secret communications between the two, so we tapped into the network links at the Matriarch's house to see if we could grab the password to the account. We got this file, but our network admin is gone for two weeks training pigeons to carry packets. So we don't actually know how to read this file. Can you help us?
This challenge will be discussed at Capture the Flag: Learning to Hack for Fun and Profit at the 2017 Grace Hopper Celebration.
