TPCTF 2017: Not Lisp
-------

**CatÃ©gorie**: Misc **Points**: 20 **Description**:

> ctong610 is trying to write a program, but he's really bad at programming so his program has both syntax errors and is way too long.
If he has 10^4 pairs of parentheses, in how many ways can they be organized validly?
(Note: (()()) is valid, but (()()( is not).

Give your answer as a number mod 10^3.

Note: ^ in this case is exponentiation, not xor.

The flag is just a number.


Write up
-------

It's the number of correct expressions of lenght corresponding to : 2*10^4 (10^4 pairs) we can do with parentheses
That corresponds to the "Nombre de Catalan". (https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nombre_de_Catalan)
The flag is simply 640.
